I am currently working as a **Research Assistant Professor** at [School of Journalism and Communication](https://jc.nju.edu.cn/en9/main.htm), [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/EN/main.htm) (**NJU**), where I am a core member of the [Computational Communication Collaboratory](https://computational-communication.com/). I am also an affiliated member of the [Web Mining Laboratory](http://weblab.com.cityu.edu.hk/blog/) at [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/) (**CityU**). 

I have obtained by Ph.D. in Communication from the Department of Media and Communication at City University of Hong Kong in 2022. With a solid background in computer programming as an undergraduate, I was trained to be a **Computational Social Scientist** by interdisciplinary scholars in my graduate studies. I have published peer-reviewed research articles on leading journals in both Communication and other social science disciplines, such as **New Media & Society** and **American Psychologist**.
