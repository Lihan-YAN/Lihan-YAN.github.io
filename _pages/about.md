I am currently a **Research Assistant Professor** at the [School of Journalism and Communication](https://jc.nju.edu.cn/en9/main.htm), [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/EN/main.htm) (**NJU**), where I am a core member of the [Computational Communication Collaboratory](https://computational-communication.com/). I am also an affiliated member at the [Web Mining Laboratory](http://weblab.com.cityu.edu.hk/blog/), [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/) (**CityU**). 

I obtained my Ph.D. in Communication in 2022 from the Department of Media and Communication, City University of Hong Kong. With a solid background in programming, I was trained to be a **Computational Social Scientist** by interdisciplinary scholars during my graduate studies. I have published peer-reviewed articles on high ranking journals in Communication and other social science disciplines, such as **New Media & Society** and **American Psychologist**.
