I am currently working as an Assistant Research Fellow at the [School of Journalism and Communication](https://jc.nju.edu.cn/en9/main.htm) at [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/EN/main.htm). I am a core member of the [Computational Communication Collaboratory](https://computational-communication.com/) at Nanjing University (NJU) and an affiliated member of the [Web Mining Laboratory](http://weblab.com.cityu.edu.hk/blog/) at City University of Hong Kong (CityU). 

I obtained by Ph.D. in Communication in Aug 2022 from the Department of Media and Communication at City University of Hong Kong. With a solid background in software engineering, I was trained to be a **Computational Social Scientist** by interdisciplinary scholars. During my Ph.D. studies, I have published articles in high impact journals in social sciences, such as **New Media & Society** and **American Psychologist**.
